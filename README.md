## Assumptions
I did not add the extra feature and unique scene and I did not implement bounding volumes. I still completed 7 objectives 1-6 and 8. An assumption was I made epislon = 0.01f to prevent shadows on the spheres. I made the assumption that my render time is okay, it is longer for macho-cows.
